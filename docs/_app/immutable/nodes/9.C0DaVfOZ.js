Monte Carlo simulation offers a powerful alternative by modeling thousands of possible future price paths based on statistical principles, providing a probability distribution of outcomes rather than single-point predictions.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">This method, named after the famous casino due to its reliance on random sampling, has been used in finance for decades. In cryptocurrency analysis, it excels at capturing the extreme volatility and fat-tailed distributions characteristic of digital asset prices.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">How Geometric Brownian Motion Works</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The simulation uses Geometric Brownian Motion, the same mathematical model underlying Black-Scholes option pricing. It assumes prices follow a random walk with drift (overall trend) and volatility (random fluctuation magnitude). Thousands of paths are generated by applying small random shocks over time.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Each path represents one possible future scenario. By running ten thousand or more simulations, the tool builds a robust picture of potential outcomes—from conservative to extreme.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Key Outputs Explained</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Probability of success shows the percentage of simulated paths reaching your target return. Expected value provides the average outcome across all scenarios. Value at Risk indicates worst-case losses at specific confidence levels, helping quantify downside exposure.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Median outcomes often differ significantly from averages in skewed distributions common to crypto, making both metrics valuable for planning.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Practical Applications</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Investors can test different holding periods and volatility assumptions to see how time horizon affects probability of success. Traders can assess whether current pricing offers sufficient edge given projected risk. Long-term holders gain insight into drawdown likelihood and recovery probabilities.</p> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">The simulation helps separate skill from luck by showing whether past success was probable or exceptional under reasonable assumptions.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">Limitations and Proper Use</h2> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">While powerful, Monte Carlo relies on input assumptions. Historical volatility may not predict future conditions, and extreme events often occur more frequently than models suggest. The tool works best as one input among many in decision-making.</p> <h2 class="svelte-q8x3kg">FAQ</h2> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">What volatility should I use?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Start with recent 30-90 day annualized volatility, then test higher and lower values for sensitivity.</p></details> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">How many simulations are enough?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">Ten thousand provides excellent statistical stability for most practical purposes.</p></details> <details class="svelte-q8x3kg"><summary class="svelte-q8x3kg">Can it predict exact prices?</summary> <p class="svelte-q8x3kg">No—it provides probability distributions, not specific predictions.</p></details> <p class="italic-note svelte-q8x3kg">In uncertain markets, probability thinking beats prediction.</p></article></div>');function T(m){var e=q();k("q8x3kg",d=>{var a=x(),g=h(f(a),6);t(4),o(()=>l(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post6`)),v(()=>{y.title="Monte Carlo Simulation for Crypto Risk Assessment | Blog"}),i(d,a)});var s=r(e),u=r(s);t(4),n(s),t(2),n(e),o(()=>l(u,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(m,e)}export{T as component,S as universal};
